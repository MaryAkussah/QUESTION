                    <p class="section-lea">Your profile of scores indicates the repertoire of conflict-handling skills that you possess and use in conflict situations. One of the most often asked questions is “What are the right answers?” in this type of test, there are no “right” answers. All five modes of handling conflict are useful in various situations, and each represents a set of useful social skills. The effectiveness of any handling of conflict depends on the conflict and the skill that is employed.</p>
                    <p>Each of us is capable of using all five conflict modes, and none of us can be characterized as having a single rigid style of dealing with conflict. However, because of personality traits or habits, individuals tend to use one or two modes at a greater frequency than the others.</p>

<h1>The Five Conflict-Handling Modes</h1>
  <p>The Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Modes Instrument (TKI) assesses an individual’s behavior in conflict situations—that is, situations in which the concerns of two people appear to be incompatible. In conflict situations, we can describe a person’s behavior along two basic dimensions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Assertiveness:</strong> The extent to which the individual attempts to satisfy their own concerns.</li>
    <li><strong>Cooperativeness:</strong> The extent to which the individual attempts to satisfy the concerns of others.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>These two dimensions of behavior can be used to define five methods of dealing with conflict. These five conflict-handling modes are shown below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Competing</li>
    <li>Collaborating</li>
    <li>Compromising</li>
    <li>Avoiding</li>
    <li>Accommodating</li>
</ul>

<h3>COMPETING</h3>
  <p>Competing is assertive and uncooperative, a power-oriented mode. When competing, an individual pursues his or her own concerns at the other person's expense, using whatever power seems appropriate to win his or her position. Competing might mean standing up for your rights, defending a position you believe is correct, or simply trying to win.</p>
  
  <h3>COLLABORATING</h3>
  <p>Collaborating is both assertive and cooperative. When collaborating, an individual attempts to work with the other person to find a solution that fully satisfies the concerns of both. It involves digging into an issue to identify the underlying concerns of the two individuals and to find an alternative that meets both sets of concerns. Collaborating between two persons might take the form of exploring a disagreement to learn from each other's insights, resolving some condition that would otherwise have them competing for resources, or confronting and trying to find a creative solution to an interpersonal problem.</p>
  
  <h3>COMPROMISING</h3>
  <p>Compromising is intermediate in both assertiveness and cooperativeness. When compromising, the objective is to find an expedient, mutually acceptable solution that partially satisfies both parties. Compromising falls on a middle ground between competing and accommodating, giving up more than competing but less than accommodating. Likewise, it addresses an issue more directly than avoiding but doesn't explore it in as much depth as collaborating. Compromising might mean splitting the difference, exchanging concessions, or seeking a quick middle-ground position.</p>
  
  <h3>AVOIDING</h3>
  <p>Avoiding is unassertive and uncooperative. When avoiding, an individual does not immediately pursue his or her own concerns or those of the other person. He or she does not address the conflict. Avoiding might take the form of diplomatically sidestepping an issue, postponing an issue until a better time, or simply withdrawing from a threatening situation.</p>
  
  <h3>ACCOMMODATING</h3>
  <p>Accommodating is unassertive and cooperative-the opposite of competing. When accommodating, an individual neglects his or her own concerns to satisfy the concerns of the other person; there is an element of self-sacrifice in this mode. Accommodating might take the form of selfless generosity or charity, obeying another person's order when you would prefer not to, or yielding to another's point of view.</p>

  <h3>Your TKI Profile</h3>
  <p>Your profile of TKI, shown below, indicates the repertoire of conflict-handling modes you use in the kinds of conflicts you face. Your scores are arranged in descending order by percentile, with your highest score indicating your most frequently used conflict mode.</p>
  <p>Your raw score on each conflict-handling mode is simply the number of times you chose a TKI statement for that mode. More important are your percentile scores. These show how your raw scores compare to those of a representative sample of 8,000 employed adults who have already taken the TKI. Your percentile scores show the percentage of people in the sample who scored the same as or lower than you on each mode.</p>
  <p>Your profile shows that you scored highest on collaborating, where your score of 11 gave you a percentile score of 99. This means you scored higher than 99 percent of the people in the sample on collaborating. In contrast, you scored lowest on compromising, where you scored higher than only 7 percent of the sample.</p>
  <p>The solid vertical lines at the 25th and 75th percentiles separate the middle 50 percent of the scores on each mode from the top 25 percent and the bottom 25 percent. Scores that fall in the top 25 percent are considered high. Similarly, scores that fall in the bottom 25 percent are considered low. Scores that fall in the middle 50 percent are considered medium. Look at your scores to see where they fall within this range.</p>

  <h3>Interpreting Your Scores</h3>
  <p>When you look at your profile on the TKI, you probably want to know, "What are the correct answers?" In the case of conflict-handling behavior, there are no right or wrong answers. All five modes are useful in some situations: each represents a set of useful social skills. Our conventional wisdom recognizes, for example, that often "Two heads are better than one" (collaborating). But it also says, "Kill your enemies with kindness" (accommodating), "Split the difference" (compromising), "Leave well enough alone" (avoiding), and "Might makes right" (competing). The effectiveness of a given conflict-handling mode depends on the requirements of the specific situation and the skill with which you use that mode.</p>
  <p>You are capable of using all five conflict-handling modes; you cannot be characterized as having a single, rigid style of dealing with conflict. However, most people use some modes more readily than others, develop more skills in those modes, and therefore tend to rely on them more heavily. Many have a clear favorite. The conflict behaviors you use are the result of both your personal predispositions and the requirements of the situations in which you find yourself.</p>
  <p>The following pages provide feedback on your conflict-handling modes as indicated by your TKI scores, beginning with your most frequently used mode, collaborating.</p>
