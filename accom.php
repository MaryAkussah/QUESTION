    <li>When you realize that you are wrong - to allow a better solution to be considered, to learn from others, and to show that you are reasonable</li>
    <li>When the issue is much more important to the other person than it is to you-to satisfy the needs of others and as a goodwill gesture to help maintain a cooperative relationship</li>
    <li>When you want to build up social credits for later issues that are important to you</li>
    <li>When you are outmatched and losing and more competition would only damage your cause</li>
    <li>When preserving harmony and avoiding disruption are especially important</li>
    <li>When you want to help your employees develop by allowing them to learn from their mistakes</li>

  <h3>Questions to Ask</h3>
  <p>Because you scored in the medium range on accommodating, there is little reason to suspect that you overuse or underuse this mode in general. However, the questions below can help you determine if you are overusing or underusing accommodating in specific situations.</p>
  <p><strong>Signs of overuse:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do you feel that your ideas and concerns sometimes don't get the attention they deserve? Deferring too much to the concerns of others can deprive you of influence, respect, and recognition. It can also deprive the organization of your potential contributions.</li>
    <li>Is discipline lax? Although discipline for its own sake may be of little value, some rules and procedures are crucial and need to be enforced. Accommodating on these issues may harm you, others, or the organization.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Signs of underuse:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do you sometimes have trouble building goodwill with others? Accommodation on minor issues that are important to others is a gesture of goodwill.</li>
    <li>Do others sometimes seem to regard you as unreasonable?</li>
    <li>Do you occasionally have trouble admitting when you are wrong?</li>
    <li>Do you recognize legitimate exceptions to the rules?</li>
    <li>Do you know when to give up?</li>
  </ul>
