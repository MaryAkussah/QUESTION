                        <ul>
    <li>When goals are moderately important but not worth the effort or the potential disruption involved in using more assertive modes</li>
    <li>When two opponents with equal power are strongly committed to mutually exclusive goals-as in labor-management bargaining</li>
    <li>When you want to achieve a temporary settlement of a complex issue</li>
    <li>When you need to arrive at an expedient solution under time pressure</li>
    <li>As a backup mode when collaboration or competition fails</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Questions to Ask</h3>
  <p>Because you scored low on compromising, there is a good chance that you are underusing this mode. To help you determine whether that is the case, consider the following questions:</p>
  <p><strong>Signs of underuse:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do you sometimes find yourself too sensitive or embarrassed to engage in the give-and-take of bargaining? This reticence can keep you from getting a fair share in negotiations-for yourself, your team, or your organization.</li>
    <li>Do you sometimes find it difficult to make concessions? Without this safety valve, you may have trouble gracefully getting out of mutually destructive arguments, power struggles, and so on.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In contrast, the fact that you scored low on compromising makes it unlikely that you are overusing this mode. However, you may be interested in these signs of overuse in others:</p>
  <p><strong>Signs of overuse:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Concentrating so heavily on the practicalities and tactics of compromise that one loses sight of larger issues. Neglected issues may include principles, values, long-term objectives, or company welfare.</li>
    <li>Creating a cynical climate of gamesmanship. An emphasis on bargaining and trading may create a climate that undermines interpersonal trust and deflects attention from the merits of the issues.</li>
  </ul>
