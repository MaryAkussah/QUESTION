    <li>When quick, decisive action is vital-for example, in an emergency</li>
    <li>On important issues when unpopular courses of action need implementing - for example, cost cutting, enforcing unpopular rules, discipline</li>

  <h3>Questions to Ask</h3>
  <p>Because you scored in the medium range on competing, there is little reason to suspect that you overuse or underuse this mode in general. However, the questions below can help you determine if you are overusing or underusing competing in specific situations.</p>
  <p><strong>Signs of overuse:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are you surrounded by "yes" people? If so, perhaps it's because they have learned that it's unwise to disagree with you or have given up trying to influence you. This closes you off from information.</li>
    <li>Are others afraid to admit ignorance and uncertainties to you? In a competitive climate, one must fight for influence and respect, acting more certain and confident than one feels. This means that people are less able to ask for information and opinions-they are less likely to learn.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Signs of underuse:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do you often feel powerless in situations? You may be unaware of the power you have, unskilled in its use, or uncomfortable with the idea of using it. This may hinder your effectiveness by restricting your influence.</li>
    <li>Do you sometimes have trouble taking a firm stand, even when you see the need? Sometimes concerns for others' feelings or anxieties about the use of power cause people to vacillate, which may result in postponing the decision and adding to the suffering and/or resentment of others.</li>
  </ul>
