    <li>When an issue is unimportant or when other, more important issues are pressing</li>
    <li>When you perceive no chance of satisfying your concerns-for example, when you have low power or you are frustrated by something that would be very difficult to change</li>
    <li>When the potential costs of confronting a conflict outweigh the benefits of its resolution</li>
    <li>When you need to let people cool down - to reduce tensions to a productive level and to regain perspective and composure</li>
    <li>When gathering more information outweighs the advantages of an immediate decision</li>
    <li>When others can resolve the issue more effectively</li>
    <li>When the issue seems tangential or symptomatic of another, more basic issue</li>

  <h3>Questions to Ask</h3>
  <p>Because you scored low on avoiding, there is a good chance that you are underusing this mode. To help you determine whether that is the case, consider the following questions:</p>
  <p><strong>Signs of underuse:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do you sometimes find yourself hurting people's feelings or stirring up hostilities? You may need to exercise more discretion and tact, framing issues in nonthreatening ways.</li>
    <li>Do you sometimes feel harried or overwhelmed by a number of issues? You may need to devote more time to setting priorities - that is, deciding which issues are relatively unimportant and perhaps delegating them to others.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In contrast, the fact that you scored low on avoiding makes it unlikely that you are overusing this mode. However, you may be interested in these signs of overuse in others:</p>
  <p><strong>Signs of overuse:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Causing coordination to suffer because people have trouble getting one's input on issues.</li>
    <li>Creating an atmosphere of "walking on eggshells." Sometimes a dysfunctional amount of energy is devoted to caution and avoiding issues, indicating that those issues need to be faced and resolved.</li>
    <li>Decisions on important issues getting made by default.</li>
  </ul>
